## Merge Sort Overview

Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by dividing the input array into smaller subarrays, sorting them recursively, and then merging the sorted subarrays to obtain the final sorted array.

## Visualizing Merge Sort

**Step 1**

Divide Split the array into smaller subarrays.

**Step 2**

Divide Split the subarrays further

**Step 3**

Merge the subarrays back together while sorting

**Step 4**

Merge the remaining subarrays
